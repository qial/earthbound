These Notes are a More up to date version of the SDA notes written by UUSDFG. I literally copy pasted it and changed the stuff that was out of date. This route is going with no RNG manipulation in mind. 

**General** 

Assume you should avoid all battles unless otherwise noted. 

If an enemy drops an item and you don't know what to do with it, plan on dropping it at some point so it doesn't force you to rearrange your items later. If you keep it, keep in mind that items won't go where they're expected. 

Stutter-stepping: by quickly and lightly tapping the dpad in any given direction, certain enemies can be avoided as their movement is based on your movement frames. 

Any time there is text mash with A and L-trigger as fast as you can. Note that during long text sequences the A+L combination will automatically choose "Yes", while mashing B+Select will automatically choose "No" if those options present themselves. 

Despawning: if you walk off and back on screen when you see an enemy you can despawn them. horizontal enemies take about 1/3 of a screen and vertical enemies take about 1/2 

**Intro** 

Choose one letter character names to minimize the time the game will spend drawing them. 

Grab the bat in Tracy's room. Walk underneath the desk to avoid her running into you. 

Climb the hill, talk to Pokey, and return home. Say, "Yes," when asked if you'd like to go back to sleep. 

Walk downstairs and open the door. Agree to join Pokey, then talk to your mom to change clothes. 

Talk to Pokey again to have him join your party. Try to leave the house, then answer the phone. 

Leave the house. Proceed to the top of the hill. 

there are 3 enemies that can spawn on this hill: Dogs, Crows, and snakes 
Dogs: despawn entirely 
Crows: they have a swaying pattern and if they appear to be "stuck" you can run past them 
snakes: if you feel confident stutterstepping you can stutter past these enemies, otherwise despawn 


Talk to Picky at the top of the hill. Answer, "Yes," to the questions asked by Pokey and Buzz-buzz. 

Pick up the Bread roll on the way back down the hill. ( we get it now as accidental crow fights can't steal it) 

Use Auto fight through the entire Starman Junior battle. 

Go into Pokey's house and talk to his dad. 

Leave the house, getting the Sound stone from Buzz-buzz on the way. Answer, "Yes," to his first question and, "No," to his second. 

**Frank** 

Get the Mr. Baseball cap from the treehouse west of the library and equip it immediately. 

Pick up the Hamburger from the trash can next to the burger shop. 

Go into the drugstore. 

Withdraw $40 from the ATM. 

Talk to the shopkeeper on the right. 

Buy the Tee ball bat and equip it, selling back the Cracked bat in the process. 

Buy the Baseball cap, equip it, and sell the Mr. Baseball Cap. 

Buy the cheap bracelet and equip it. 

Walk down to the arcade. Do not fight any Sharks that randomly spawn. 

If you walk along the left side of the street to the left of the drugstore, then walk right along the top of the hospital, you can prevent the Sharks from spawning.  

Fight the Pogo Punk NPC standing south of the arcade entrance. If you are below 30 HP or so after the fight, heal with the Bread roll. 

This fight gets you a guaranteed Hamburger drop and sets up Ness to reach level 5 before Frankystein. 

Go into the arcade and fight the Pogo Punk who accosts you on the bottom floor. 

Fight the Yes Man Junior blocking the door. 

Heal before fighting Frank. Prefer Lifeup — do not use Hamburgers unless you have no choice. 
Fight Frank. If you take damage, heal. Otherwise, bash. 

If Ness runs out of PP, consider simply bashing and hoping you survive. If you need to use Hamburgers, you probably aren't having a good fight, and you'll make things harder in later splits since you won't have as many healing items. For casual runs, use up your Hambugers if you need to, and plan to buy more later. 

Fight Frankystein. It attacks every other turn, starting with the second. The second attack will likely do 15-20 damage; later attacks have a chance of being in the 35-40 range. Bash through the fight and heal as necessary. 

After defeating Frankystein, enter the arcade, then immediately go out the back door again and talk to Frank to restore your HP and PP. If Ness has 10+ PP and 40+ HP, you may consider skipping this. 

**Titanic Ant** 

Go into the city hall and talk to the mayor to get the Key to the shack (agree not to accept any responsibility). 

You can buy more burgers now to be safe at this point or if you want to play risky you can progress with what you have. If you have used any burgers on frank it is highly recommended that you buy more. 

Walk up to the entertainer's shack and use the Key to the shack on the door to enter. Proceed into Giant Step. 

You can avoid the, "The door is locked," text by using the trees south of the shack to line you up with the right side of the door. 

Fight Attack Slugs until you reach level 8. Avoid fighting Black Antoids and Rowdy Mice as they take longer to fight than Slugs (stutter-stepping can help with this). Use Lifeup to heal as necessary. Avoid using Hamburgers in this part of Giant Step. If you manage to only fight slugs the amount of slugs you need to kill is 22.  

Note 1: Black dots on the bottom floor are always slugs. On floors 2 if its not a group of 4 dots close together assume they are ants. On floor 3 slugs come in packs of 6. Typically you want to fight 4 packs of 4 on floor 1 and a group of 6 on floor 3. 

Note 2: If on floor 1 you decide to go in any of the doors, the black dots inside will always be antoids. 

Once you get level 8 open up your stats menu. Check your offense, if you have 23 offense avoid fighting ants, if you have 24 or 25 offense you are able to insta-kill ants on contact as long as its a single ant. 

Go outside and use lifeup. There should be a butterfly outside. Grab the butterfly and walk to the right edge of the cliff to respawn another butterfly in. You want to have full pp for titanic ant. 

Proceed toward Titanic Ant. Pick up the Hamburger from the gift box in the first room. 

Avoid fighting more than one Antoid at a time. If you have 23 offense try to either despawn the antoids completly or try to stutterstep past them. 

Use a Hamburger to recover Ness's HP if he's below 65 or so before fighting Titanic Ant. Avoid using Lifeup between the magic butterfly and the fight. 

Fight Titanic Ant. Use Rockin α twice ASAP, then bash. If you can afford the PP, use Lifeup to heal the first time (if the Ant uses Magnet, prioritize getting in two Rockins). Heal with Hamburgers after that. if you bought extra burgers before this fight. heal anytime he hits you after you use your 2 rockins. If you didn't buy extra burgers you may want to heal anytime you go below 50. Note however that Titanic ant can do over 60 damage if he manages to get a SMASH. 

Visit Giant Step. 

Walk back down to the entrance. 

Answer, "No," to the police officer's question. 

**Captain Strong** 

If you are low on burgers you can choose to buy more. 4-5 burgers is usually pretty safe 

Walk to the police station and tell Captain Strong that you want to go to Twoson. 

Bash the cops. Use burgers to recover if your HP drop below 55 (can try going down to 50 if you're low of burgers). Use lifeup if ness is below 30hp Try to keep 20pp for captain strong. 

If you have 20pp captain strong will usually go down with 2 rockins. otherwise bash and heal if your hp goes down. captain strong has a chance to do in the mid 40's in damage so keep that in mind when deciding to heal. 

Walk down the road out of Onett. Pick up an Exit mouse on the way. 

Grab the Hamburger by the side of the road unless you have three or more left. 

Walk into Twoson. Stay away from trees that could hide mushrooms behind them. 

**Pencil Eraser** 

Walk into the Twoson department store (go southeast from the entrance to Twoson) and withdraw $500 from the ATM. Save using the payphone there. (This sets up a deathwarp later.) 

If you bought Hamburgers earlier, withdraw enough cash to get up to at least $500. 

Walk down to Apple Kid's. Feed him one of your burgers (or some other food item if you got one from enemies) and pay him $200. Get the Receiver phone. 

Walk into Peaceful Rest Valley. Try to pick up a magic butterfly on the way. Unless Ness is at full health, use Lifeup immediately after getting the butterfly. 

Get close enough to the pencil statue that you can see it, then walk back to Twoson. This should trigger the phone call from Apple Kid when you get back. 

Talk to Apple Kid in the southwest corner of Burglin Park. 

**Mr. Carpainter** 

Go back into Peaceful Rest Valley. Use the Pencil eraser to remove the pencil statue, then proceed into Happy-Happy Village. You want to get enough magic butterflies along the way to restore Ness to full HP and PP. There are three places where butterflies commonly spawn: 
1)Just after the first bridge you cross, at the valley's northwest corner. 
2)To the east of the broken bridge, on the west side of the peninsula in the middle. 
3)Near the bend at the northeast side of the valley, before you head south past the cabin. 

If you accidentally get in any fights here use rockin to finish the fights as fast as possible. The chance of running away from the enemies here is really low so its usually safer to fight. If you don't have any pp and are fighting sprouts you may consider trying to run as these enemies can call for help. 

Stop in the drugstore. 

If you have leftover Cookies or Bread rolls, drop them now. 

From the shopkeeper on the right: 

Buy the Sand lot bat and equip it, selling back the Tee ball bat. 

Buy the Holmes hat and equip it, selling back the Baseball cap. 

From the shopkeeper on the left: 

Buy two Refreshing herbs. 

Buy enough Croissants to bring you up to two healing items (either Croissants or Hamburgers). Make sure you have at least 1 open inventory slot 

Walk through the tunnel to the left of the drugstore. Avoid any cultist fights. If you manage to get ambushed you will have to fight as it is impossible to run away from cultist. 

RULE OF 2: if at any point there are 2 cultist on the battle field use rockin. Even if they are at full health as they have a chance to call for help 

Enter the cabin and talk to Paula. 

Fight the Cultists outside. Remembering the rule of 2 posted above 

Heal with a Croissant or Hamburger after the fight if Ness is low on HP. 
Enter the village hall and go toward Carpainter. Don't get any of the items just yet. If Ness has 20+ PP, you may consider using Rockin to open the fight with the one mandatory Cultist. Otherwise, it's probably better to save it in case the Cultists calls for help. 

make sure you have at least 1 open inventory slot but do NOT heal right before the Carpainter fight. 

Fight Carpainter. Agree to become his right-hand man. There are a couple approaches you can take in this fight: 

If Ness has 20+ PP, or you're feeling gutsy, go for a one-round KO by using Rockin in the first turn. If both of Carpainter's lightning strikes connect, you will win. 

If you're feeling less gutsy, wait until the 2nd turn to use Rockin, since Carpainter will use Lifeup in the second turn and recover all the damage you would have dealt. if you have less than 23 hp heal with an this turn. 

On turn 3 he will bash. If you have between 23-50hp heal on this turn. You want to try to keep your hp low for the deathwarp so don't use lifeup unless you have no other options. 

Once Carpainter has put up his psychic shield, make sure that you do not use Lifeup the turn after he utilizes a paint attack (unless you have taken mortal damage). If you use Lifeup then, a reflected Thunder attack can miss (video). Carpainter attacks once every three turns, so you can heal on the following turn. 

If you have a Hamburger or Crossaint left in Ness's inventory, drop it 

Pick up the Skip sandwich from the left-hand present on the way out. 

Use the Key to the cabin on the cell door to rescue Paula. 

Check your health. If you have 60 or more hp you may want to consider walking back to Twoson as the bridge will be fixed now. This can also set you up safer for later as you will have an extra teddy bear to work with later. (in this situation skip to the section Titled WALK BACK) 

If you Have less than 60 hp you want to set up for the deathwarp In this case follow these steps 

**Deathwarp** 

Rearrange your inventory to make dying faster: 

Open ness's inventory and give the cheap bracelet and holmes hat to paula (do not requip) 

Have Paula drop the Teddy bear. 

Go into the Lilliput Steps cave and purposefully get red swirled by the Mole Playing Rough that should spawn near the entrance. Have Ness use the ATM card and Paula attack until both Ness and Paula are dead. Say that you want to continue playing. 

Withdraw all the money from the ATM once you have death warped back to Twoson Dept Store. 

Go northeast to the hospital and revive Paula. 

Go south to the preschool. (SKip next section and proceed to "Preschool" section) 

**WALK BACK** 
(skip to preschool if you chose to deathwarp) 

give the cheap bracelet and holmes hat to paula and equip them . 

walk and leave happy happy village from the left. Walk back to twoson and use the new fixed bridge to get back faster. If you get in a fight with a ufo or spinning robo, Paula can 1 shot them with freeze 

When you get back to twoson stop at the bus station and Withdraw $400 then walk to the preschool 

**Preschool** 

Enter the school and go left to the middle room to trigger Paula's fathers dialogue. Go up into Paula's room and get the Teddy bear from the gift box. (If you chose to walk back you can skip this but its still safer to pick it up) 

Go talk to Everdred to get the Wad of bills. 

Head over to the east side of the Chaos Theater and talk to the guy in green to get the Backstage pass. 

Enter the Chaos Theater from the right. Hug the front wall of the theater to avoid triggering a photo shoot. 

Before using the Backstage Pass on the ticket vendor, take this time to move the Backstage Pass over to Paula and equip the Cheap Bracelet and Holmes Hat on her. 

Talk to the girl on the left side of the room to go backstage, then immediately leave the backstage area. Watch the show. 

Walk into the office, go behind the desk, and use the Wad of bills on Mr. Poochyfud. 

Hold right when leaving the theater to avoid the photo shoot. It's safe to go south when Ness is completely past the flat wall to the right of the door. You can cross just north of the streetpost, though it might be easier to just go around to the south. Talk to the guy in red and tell him you want to go to Threed. 

Get on the bus. 

Go to the graveyard to the Northwest of town. Use the gravestones to help you block possible spawns. 

Walk up to the zombies at the northwest end of town and let them see you (watch for when they turn around). Go back to the hotel and follow the woman inside. 

There are no spawn tiles between the north row of tombstones and the trees, so it's easiest to walk through there. 
Watch out for flies spawning behind the trees near the zombies. If you see flies up there, try walking down toward the dead tree (you don't need to walk all the way down) to despawn them. 

Follow the woman into the room on the left. Note that all party members are healed and if either party member is dead they will be revived at this point. Try to leave the prison once you've been captured. 

**Jeff's Adventures in Winters** 

Walk down into Maxwell's room, on the left side of the bottom floor. Talk to him. Use the Key to the locker on one of the lockers in the room on the right (it doesn't matter which one), then go back and talk to Maxwell again to get the Bad key machine. 

Use the Bad key machine on the leftmost locker in the bottom row and the rightmost locker in the top row. This will get you the Pop gun and Holmes hat. Equip both. 

Leave the school and talk to Tony to jump over the gate. 

Go into the drugstore and talk to the woman. Agree to buy gum from her. Talk to Bubble Monkey. 

Walk down near the shores of Lake Tess. Go into the tent on the far left and have some stew. 

Walk over to the dirt patch on the peninsula to the east to trigger the lake crossing. There are a couple things to watch for: 
There is a photo shoot between the eastmost tent and the lake. You can avoid it by either going around the north side of the tent or very carefully walking along the southern edge of the tent. 

You want Bubble Monkey to be close to Jeff when you reach the dirt patch. Otherwise, Bubble Monkey will walk very slowly over to Jeff to get his piece of gum. If Bubble Monkey is lagging behind, wiggle a bit to encourage him to catch up. 

After Tessie, walk down and left, then hug the left wall to prevent a Gruff  from spawning  

Enter the Brick Road dungeon. Take the bottom path to fight the first Worthless Protoplasm. Autofight the Protoplasm to death. Run if it calls for help and you don't kill the first one soon after. 

This is one of the hardest fights in the game, no joke. 

Use the boiled egg after this fight if you took damage 

See if you can sneak past the Mad Duck. None of the enemies in here can ambush you, so don't worry about that. 
If Jeff is low on health, pick up the Croissant from the gift box near the Mad Duck and eat it. 

Try to skip the second Worthless Protoplasm, but don't worry too much if you don't. 

To set up the skip, walk along the top edge of the path, then, when the Protoplasm starts moving toward you, walk straight down so you're on the row below it and continue going to the left. You will go past the Protoplasm if Bubble Monkey doesn't get caught  

Ignore Brick Road and proceed into the cave. 

Pond cave is full of enemy spawns that all can be stutter stepped away from. over all the passages are too narrow to safely stutter pass them so try to use stutter steps when despawning to reduce the length of ground you have to walk from enemies chasing you. All the enemies here can be stutter stepped around except for the mushrooms. 

Only get the Hamburger (from the gift box in the first room) if Jeff is critically low on HP and you're worried about getting into fights in the cave (eat it immediately if you do get it). 

Pick up the Bottle rocket from the gift box near the crystals in the last room. 

Use the Pak of bubble gum near the rope in the last room to climb up. Try to get Bubble Monkey next to Jeff when you do this since Bubble Monkey flies very slowly. 

Go into the lab and talk to Dr. Andonuts. Say, "No," to the first question (the one about the donut). The answer to the second question (about Stonehenge) doesn't matter. 

Enter the Sky Runner and mash A until the Sky Runner lifts off. 

The first Sky Runner cutscene takes a little over 2 minutes and requires no inputs once the Sky Runner has lifted off, so this is a good time for a quick break. 

**Mini Barf** 
Agree to let Jeff join the party. 

Use the Bad key machine on the door to leave the prison. 

Go out the northeast corner of the graveyard. 

Get the Teddy bear from the garbage can. 

This makes the Threed tunnel safer. If you are going for a top-tier time, you might want to skip this for now and pick it up before Shrooom! instead. 

Cut back southwest, past the (real) circus tent and then go south to reach Boogey Tent. 

Have Ness use Rockin and Jeff fire his Big bottle rocket. If you got in fights earlier and Paula knows Psi Fire α, have her use that; otherwise, have her use freeze for the chance to solidify. If you don't win on the first turn, have Ness use Rockin again, Paula either use Fire or freeze again, and Jeff fire his Bottle rocket. If that still doesn't do it, have Ness use Rockin (or heal people) and Paula pray. 
Pick up the Jar of Fly Honey. 

Go up through the gap to the left of the hospital. Walk behind the building on the left and talk to the arms dealer. 

Sell the Defense spray (from Jeff's inventory). 

Buy 3-4 Bottle rockets for Jeff (+1 if you used one on boogey tent) 
Optional: buy the toy air gun 

Walk up past the right side of the circus tent to trigger the call from Apple Kid. 
Walk back down in front of the entrance to the circus tent and wait for the Zombie paper to be delivered. 

Enter the tent. 

Use Zombie paper 

Leave the tent, go up to the hotel and stay the night. 
(There is a ATM here if needed) 

Walk to the entrance to the tunnel at the northwest side of town. 
Go through the tunnel. Despawning enemies in the large rooms is tricky and somewhat risky since enemies can spawn on top of you in the corridors. Therefore, if you can't get an empty room, you may want to tolerate having only a couple zombies in the room. Try to avoid flies and zombie dogs. 
You can use Fire + Rockin on Urban Zombies. If you bought the toy air gun have ness and jeff bash while paula uses fire. 

You can use Freeze on Zombie Dogs. If you get in a fight with a single Zombie Dog, you can hypnotize it and then run. 

Depending on how many enemies there are in the rooms, try to get the Skip sandwich DX from the first coffin. 

Fight Mini-Barf. Have Ness use Rockin, Paula use Fire, and Jeff fire Bottle rockets. Use up all of Jeff's Bottle rockets if you have to. 

**Master Belch** 


Go through the tunnel into Saturn Valley. If you get a cockroach by the entrance to the tunnel, and Paula has at least 4 PP (she should after leveling from Mini Barf), just fight it and freeze it to death. Do the same if you get one in the last room. Try to despawn the others. 

If you picked up any Tiny Lil' Ghosts, or if anyone died, visit Dr. Saturn in the yellow building. 

Stay in the hotel (the red building) to restore everyone's HP/PP. 

Talk to the middle Mr. Saturn (not the one who's fixed in place near the top ladder) to learn the password to the waterfall. 

Go back through the tunnel. If you get a cockroach in the first room, freeze it. Despawn the others. 

Go in and out of the exit of the tunnel until there aren't any enemies in the way, then go north to the waterfall. 

Be extremely careful not to touch the D-pad in the next three minutes. 

This is the run's official bathroom break. 

Enter Belch's base. Tell the guard that you have Fly Honey or he'll fight you. 

Don't worry about despawning Foppies around the ladder since you probably won't succeed. 

If you get in a fight with one foppy bash it to death. If there are 2 have Paula freeze one while jess and jeff bash the other 

For three or more Foppies, have Ness use Rockin and Paula use Fire. 

Go left toward Belch. Stop in the one room on the main floor for a magic butterfly if Paula is low on PP  usse Freeze on Slimy Little Piles and anything you can on flies (NOTE: you cannot run from Slimy Little Piles, even if you ambush them). 

As you get near the guard, try to stutterstep around him. If you see flies on the left when you try fight the guard as he will always be alone 

Fight Master Belch. 

For the first round, have the party member with Fly Honey use it on Master Belch and all other party members defend. 

In the second round, have Ness use a Refreshing herb if someone become nauseous; otherwise, he can use Rockin. Paula should use Freeze β and Jeff should fire a Bottle rocket if he still has one. 

In the third round, have Ness use Rockin or defend, depending on how close you are to finishing off Belch's 650 HP. Paula should use Freeze β. Jeff should fire a Bottle rocket if he still has any left, or defend if not. 

If you didn't get the chance to use a Refreshing herb during the fight for some reason, treat any lingering nausea now. Also use Lifeup if anyone is really low on HP. 

Use the Exit mouse to get out. 

**Mine Entrance** 

On the way back to Threed, pick up the Protein drink from the first gift box you pass (the north one). Ness should get it. If he doesn't, clear out whatever extra item is in his inventory and move the Protein drink to him (he needs it for later). 

Back in Threed, check the sign on the south side of the street to pick up a bus into Dusty Dunes. 

Stutter-step past the Mole Playing Rough. 

Go east through the desert, sticking close to the rocks to minimize the risk of battles. 

Pick up the Big bottle rocket from the gift box before the shack. 

Stop in the shack and stay the night to recover everyone's HP and PP. 

Talk to Gerardo outside the shack. Feed him Paula's Bread roll. 

Walk into Fourside and buy a ticket at the Topolla theater (from the guy on the right). 

Walk to the guy blocking the gap by the counter and... 

Have Ness give the Big bottle rocket to Jeff. 
give paula the backstage pass, the pack of gum, and the bad key machine.  

Use the Show ticket on the guy. 

Go into the office on the left and talk to the theater manager. 

Leave and walk back into the mine. 

Note: at this point of the run ness has a chance of getting homesick. If this happens find a phone and call your mom twice( the first time wont cure it) 

**Mine** 

Note: keep in mind that you can stutterstep away from the snakes and gigantic ants 

If you get in fights with snakes or gigantic ants use freeze on them. Noosemen and ducks use fire/rockin 

Walk all the way to the top. Keep going up at the fork. Go down the ladder. 

Go to the left to fight a mole. Have Ness defend while Paula uses Freeze β and Jeff fires the Big bottle rocket. Lifeup whoever got hit by the mole after the fight 

Take the ladder on the left up. 

Go down and around the bend. 
Pick up the Big bottle rocket on the way back up and give it to Jeff. 

Continue up, ignoring the center area to the left, and go down the ladder at the end of the hallway. 

Walk up toward the mole. Stay along the bottom wall and wiggle to pull the mole out toward you, so enemies aren't as likely to spawn behind you. Again use Freeze β + a Big bottle rocket to defeat the mole. Lifeup whoever may have gotten hit after the fight. 

Go back up the ladder you took to get in. Walk over to the central area with the Exit mice. 

Pick up the Picnic lunch from the gift box to the north/west. Ness should get it. 

Walk up toward the third mole. Again try to draw it toward you so the spawn tile behind you doesn't activate. 
for this mole fight on have ness lifeup paula every turn(even if she is at max hp) have Paula use Freeze B twice and have jeff defend. 

NOTE: there's a Secret herb just southeast of this mole. You can pick it up if Paula or Ness dies, but you will have to deal with enemies spawning behind you. If Jeff is dead, you're probably better off healing him at the hospital later. 

Go back down by the Exit mice. Take the path on the left and go down. A lot of enemies spawn in this area, so if you get a single Gigantic Ant or Thirsty Coil Snake, you may want to just fight it and move on (Freeze β should one-shot it). Draw this mole toward you as well. Use the same strategy as for the previous mole. (if paula is out of pp there is a psi caramel here but there is a chance of enemies spawning behind you so only get it as a last resort) 

Go back to the central area. Get an Exit mouse. 

Take the path down to the last mole. This is another very enemy-rich area, but it's trickier because you have to deal with Noose Men, who aren't vulnerable to Freeze. Therefore, you usually want to despawn enemies here. If you get a spawn with only Mad Ducks, you can try to sneak past them or fight, but be careful because offscreen Noose Men can join the fight if they are around. the ducks here have a 25% chance of taking aggro towards you so use this towards your advantage. 

When you finally reach the last mole, use the same strategy as for the previous two. 

Pick up the Platinum band from the gift box on the left and equip it to Ness. 

Inventory management: 

Ness: 
Drop the Sand lot bat. 
Drop any remaining Refreshing herbs.  
You want Ness to have at least 3 open inventory slots at the end of this inventory sequence. 

Jeff: 
Drop the Boiled egg if you somehow haven't used it yet. 
Drop the Holmes hat. 
Move Pack of Bubble Gum and Bad Key Machine to Paula. 
Only items Jeff should have are his gun, the ruler, and the protractor 

Whoever has Fly Honey, give to Paula. 

Use the Exit mouse and leave the mine. 

After leaving the mine, talk to Gerardo. Don't forget to do this! 

Stay at the shack unless both Ness and Paula have at least 40-ish PP remaining, and Ness and Jeff are close to full health. 

If you are new to running the game, you should always stay at the shack. 
You want Ness and Jeff to be in good shape to get through Fourside, and you want Paula to be ready for Shrooom! 

**Dept. Store Spook** 

Walk back to the Topolla Theater. Buy a Show ticket and use it. 

Go into the office. Walk behind the counter and use the Diamond on the theater manager. 

Go into the main hall and watch the show. 

Leave the theater and go into the department store. 

Withdraw at least $9000 from the ATM on the bottom floor. 

Typically, you'll have at least $10000 by this point. 

Take the escalator up and talk to the arms dealer in the side room on the second floor. 

Buy the hyper beam for Jeff selling his previous weapon 
Buy 3 Super bombs and 4-5 Big Bottle Rockets for Jeff. 
Buy 3-4 Super bombs and 4-5 Big Bottle Rockets for Paula. 
Fill Ness' remaining inventory with Super Bombs. 

Take the escalator back down and walk far enough right to trigger the kidnapping. 

For races or casual runs, making a safety save before triggering the kidnapping is recommended. 

Go up to the top of the store. You should be able to dodge the presents on the second and third floors (though there usually aren't any on the third floor). 

At the top of the last escalator, you will very likely get in a fight. 

If there is more than one enemy, have Ness throw a Super bomb at the enemy on the left and Jeff throw one at the enemy on the right. If that doesn't do it, use more Super bombs. 

If there is only one enemy, Jeff can probably take it out with a Big bottle rocket. You may also want Ness to throw a Super bomb to be sure. 

There is a good chance you will die here. It happens. 

Once you finish that fight, walk down to the bottom edge of the floor and walk under the toy display, so the enemies that likely spawned in the middle of the room can't catch you. 

Fight Dept. Store Spook. Have Ness throw a Super bomb and Jeff launch a Big bottle Rocket. Shoot another Big bottle Rocket if that somehow doesn't do it. 

If you used more than 3 super bombs at this point buy more so that Ness has 3 and Jeff has 2 
Leave the department store. 

**Evil Mani-Mani** 

If Ness or Jeff is dead you can stop on the hospital on the way to the cafe to revive them. 

Walk west through the park, then northwest to the cafe. Talk to the hostess on the far right to spawn Everdred outside. 

Go outside and talk to the guy with the hair covering his eyes on the right. Give him Jeff's protractor. 

Talk to Everdred. Make sure to say you don't want to hear his story again. 

Go back into the cafe and check the wall behind the counter (don't get too close to the bartender or you'll talk to him instead). 

Leave the Moonside cafe. Try to get past the Robo-Pump that spawns here. If it fights you either try to run away or use a Big Bottle Rocket 

Outside, go southeast and talk to the nearest Warp Man to head down by the sailor guy. 

Talk to the sailor guy, then go up to the northeast and talk to the Warp Man near the hospital steps. 

Pick up the Night pendant from the nearby gift box and equip it on Ness. 


Go through the Warp Man sequence, Before you talk to the guy in black grab the secret herb in the present above him and make sure ness has it. Then talk to the guy in black answering, "No," to the last one's question. 

Talk to the invisible man (say, "No") and then talk to Mr. T. 

Walk to the bottom edge of the hotel room and the go all the way right before going out the door. This prevents the invisible man's dialogue from triggering. 

Go west and talk to the Warp Man you talked to earlier (not the one farthest to the east) to go back down by the sailor guy. 

Talk to the sailor guy, then head over to the statue. Make sure you're as far up as you can be when you check the statue so you skip Monotoli's dialogue. 

To fight Mani-Mani: 
Have Ness throw a Super bomb while Jeff shoots a Big bottle rocket. 
If Mani-Mani is still alive after that, have Ness use Rockin while Jeff shoots a Big bottle rocket. That really should do it. 

If Ness is paralyzed, have Jeff launch Big bottle rockets. If Jeff is paralyzed, have Ness use his secret herb on jeff and then use Rockin β. 

**Monkey Cave** 

If Ness was paralyzed, move the Pencil eraser into Jeff's inventory. 

Leave the cafe. Talk to the monkey who crashes into the nearby wall. 

Walk down to the bus stop and take a bus into Dusty Dunes. 

Go into the hole with the monkeys (dodge the mole on the way in). 

Give a Skip sandwich to the monkey on the right, then a Picnic lunch to the monkey on the left. 

Go in the left door and get the Pizza out of the chest. Go out the door you just came in. 

Go in the right door and proceed to the next set of monkeys. Ignore the chests here. 

Give a Pizza to the right monkey and a Protein drink to the left monkey. 

Go in the right door. Pick up the Hamburger from the chest and continue into the next room. 

Give Jeff's Ruler to the monkey on the left and go in. Get the King banana from the monkey inside. 

Go back out to the last group of two monkeys, and this time, go in the left door. Ignore the chests you pass. 

Give the King banana to the right monkey and the Hamburger to the left monkey. 

Go in the left door and get the Bag of Dragonite from the chest. 

Go back in the right door. Use the Pencil eraser. 

Talk to Talah Rama and the monkey. 

Get the Cup of Lifenoodles and Brain food lunch from the chests. Both should go into Ness's inventory. 

Walk out. Talk to the monkey on the left, then follow it down to the street and talk to it again (dodge the mole). 

Teleport into Fourside. 

**Clumsy Robot** 

Talk to Electra in front of the Monotoli Building. 

Go into the Monotoli Building and take the two elevators up. 

Go from the top elevator into the lobby. Use the Skip Sandwich DX just before entering the next room. 

Skip the Sentry Robots. 

Hug the top wall and go into the right door as quickly as possible to dodge the first Sentry Robot. 

Run to the door on the left. 

Continue left and go into the next door. If the second Sentry Robot is blocking it, try to go around it and run into the door on the far left. 

Go under the desks to pin the third Sentry Robot against them, then wrap around the desks to the upper-left corner of the room. 
 
Squeeze between the desk in the upper left and the wall and go through the door at the top. 

Go through the left door in the next room. 

Go up-left until you've reached the top wall, then go left a little and through the door at the top. This should get you around the last Sentry Robot. 

Go through the left door again. 

Fight Clumsy Robot. You should have 4 total super bombs left at this point. Those usually kill it. 
If you do get bad luck, about all you can do is Paralyze it and then Auto Fight. The hyper beam we bought earlier is in case this happens. 

Go into Monotoli's room. You have a decision to make here. 

If Ness and Jeff have plenty of HP and Ness isn't low on PP, hold down+left and talk to Monotoli before he can run from you. This is about three seconds faster than letting him run. Make sure the pillar in the top left of the room is visable when you talk to him or you will soft-lock the game. 

If Ness or Jeff need to be healed, let Monotoli run from you. This is probably faster than skipping his dialogue and then healing later. 

Make sure you tell Monotoli that you don't want him to repeat his story (mash B+Select through his dialogue). 

If you didn't stay at the shack after the mine and Paula is low on HP, have Ness heal her now. 

Go outside and watch Pokey fly away. Walk back outside and get on the bus (note that you don't need to talk to anyone this time). 

Walk up to the entrance to the prison. The fastest route takes you past the hospital and circus tent, but watch out for the photo shoot near the tent (it helps to stay close to the fence until you're east of the tent). 

If you skipped the Teddy bear earlier, go back to the trash can northeast of the graveyard and pick up the bear on the way into the prison. 

Get on the Sky Runner. 

## Shrooom!

Give Paulas Super bombs to Ness and Big Bottle Rockets to Jeff

Go to pyramid, walk tiles to open.

Position behind the sphynx with ness's head showing, teleport up, hold up to get in

#### TODO: Pyramid strategy

Go in and out of the door until the first room is clear. Go up and down the stairs in the second room until the platform at the top is clear. 

Just before going through the door at the top of the stairs, have Paula use a Skip sandwich DX. 

Hold down when entering the next room. Go down to the last "crack" before the bottom of the room, then go right until you're below the other door, then go up. You should skip the hieroglyph. 

Go up the stairs in the next room. Go down+right slightly when you get to the middle platform, then hit up+right again near the next stairs. This should take you past the hieroglyphs in the middle. At the top platform, hold right until you are next to the door, then hit up to skip the snake. 

Take whatever fight you get in the middle room (the one with the casket covering the entrance to the Hawk eye room). Paralyze the enemies and run. 

Just before you go out the door on the right side of the middle room, have Paula use another Skip sandwich DX. 

Hold right and then tap down when you hit the stairs. You should bypass the hieroglyphs. 

In the room with the two coffins, just take whatever fight you get and use Paralysis or Hypnosis as necessary. If there are no enemies in the room, go down-right-up to dodge the hieroglyph on the wall. 

If Ness used his Cup of Lifenoodles earlier, pick up the one in the coffin on the right. 

Once again hold right and then tap down at the stairs to skip the asp. 

Go down and fight Guardian General. Have Paula and Poo use their strongest Freeze while Jeff fires a Big bottle rocket. If that doesn't do it, use Freeze some more (or use any remaining rockets). 

Go into the room on the right and hit the tile. Use Paralysis or whatever if you have to. 

If Ness is below 30 PP or so, use Poo's Brain food lunch on him. 

Go back up. Have Paula use another Skip sandwich as you near the top of the second stairs in the room that used to have Guardian General. Try to dodge hieroglyphs on the way back to the middle room (it's tricky). 

When you get into the room with the hole above the Hawk eye, if there are enemies in the room, fight the Guardian Hieroglyph on the wall just by the door you came in, then have Paula use a Skip sandwich DX and run into the hole to get by the enemies. If there are no enemies, have her use a Skip sandwich DX and run around that Guardian Hieroglyph to get into the room. 

Pick up the Hawk eye in the room below. 

Dodge the hieroglyph in this room and at the top of the stairs in the next room. 

In the room at the top of the stairs, go down to the bottom of the room (make sure you reach the bottom edge), then go right and around the hole and get the Diamond band out of the coffin. 

Make sure your previous sandwich has worn off, then have Paula use another one. 

Fall down the hole and try to ambush whatever enemy you get. 

Go into the last room and just hold right. At most one hieroglyph should come off the wall at you. Tap up when you reach the door. 

#### END Pyramid TODO

## Dungeon Man

Talk to the native for Key to the Tower

Teleport holding up+left from above merchant.

Walk through Dungeon Man. 

Talk to Dungeon Man when you get to the top. 

Take the hole out and exit. 

Use Ness SkipDX when outside, run right and go around right of pyramid, then down left.

Fights: Ness rockin and Paula freeze. BBRs no good on UFOs

Talk to native on right, go back to Dungeon Man

Take all money from ATM (round to hundred obvs)

Just take the Goodbye hole at the top, don't talk to Dungeon Man

On first floor, go right and get Talisman Ribbon if you didn't get 20k+ from ATM

All enemies near submarine are protoplasm, should run if everyone's alive

Use the revitalizer if you're ailing badly. 

Get in the submarine. 

## Deep Darkness

If Jeff has Super Bombs, give to Ness

Arms Dealer:

- Sell any BBRs on jeff
- Sell Hyper Beam
- Buy Jeff at least 11 MBRs, ideally 13
- Buy Super Bombs so Ness has 2

#### Master Barf:

- Jeff MBR, should kill

Enter Tenda then immediately leave 

Take the phone call and then teleport into Winters. 

## Winters and Starmen

NOTE: Starmen seem to always face "up," so if you have a clear shot at a Starman after it's teleported, you can run into its left or right to ambush it. 

Go down through Winters, across Lake Tess. 

Despawn the enemies by the pencil eraser the same way you despawned the goat as Jeff. 

Use Pencil Eraser on statue

Walk through cave, enemies will run.

Go into the lab. Use the revitalizer to refill your PP, then talk to the mouse to get the Eraser eraser. It should go into Paula's stuff. 

Go to Stonehenge. 

## Stonehenge Base (TODO STRATS)

When you first enter, wait at entrance for a few seconds to despawn starman.

Move Eraser eraser to Paula, use it to remove statue.

Try to run from most encounters in here. Have Ness hypnotize Mook Seniors before running. 

Take the right path in the second room. Turn right where the paths rejoin in the third room. You can probably despawn enemies without too much trouble at this point. 

In the fifth room (the one with the really high spawn rate), go in and out the door until you have a clear-ish path, then use a Skip sandwich DX from Poo's inventory to give yourself a better chance of ambushing enemies or simply bypassing them. Despawning enemies in this room is probably not worth the effort. 

Have Poo use another Skip sandwich DX when you get to the bottom of the first ladder in the next room. 

Pick up an Exit mouse. 

#### Starman Deluxe:

- Jeff MBR (Should kill it)
- Paula/Poo FreezeB

Go back to left room and talk to Dr. Andonuts

Use the Exit mouse to get out.

Teleport to Onett again, go to Library, right room, check left end of bookshelf for Shyness book.

Teleport to Tenda Village. 

Use the Shyness book on the elder. Confirm that you want a short name. 

Give Tendacrout to Paula or Poo 

Talk to the elder to get a Bag of Dragonite, move to Ness

Talk to the strong guy to move the rock blocking the rope. 

**Talk to the rock at the bottom of the rope. ITS IMPORTANT!!**

#### Lumine Hall TODO (Maze Strats/reminders)

- Fobbies: Starstorm if more than a couple
- Uncontrollable Spheres: Hypnotize and run
- Others: Freeze 'em

Go north to the rope at the dead end, near the gift box. Take that rope down. 

Go around to the rope at the far end. Ignore the first rope you pass. 

Have Poo use a Skip sandwich DX when you take the last rope out to make it easier to run past Fobbies. 

If the path to the present below  is open get it now to pick up the Rabits foot and equip it on Jeff Otherwise Fight Electro Specter 

Have Jeff launch two Multi bottle rockets. shoot another incase it doesnt work 

Pick up the Rabit Foot now if you havent already and equip it on paula. and requip the crystal charm on Jeff.  

Once you've gotten the Rabbit's foot, move the following out of Ness's inventory and into Paula's or Poo's, depending on whether Paula has room. 

Go back up, learn the new melody, and fall down the hole. 

## Plague Rat Sanctuary

Teleport into Fourside. 

Go into the museum and try to enter without paying. Agree to pay. Talk to Mr. Spoon in the back. 

Go to Topolla Theater and watch Venus concert. Go backstage and talk to Venus. 

Go back to the museum and use the Signed banana on Mr. Spoon. 

#### Sewers

- Filthy Attach Roaches: Freeze
- Others: Run

Go into the sewer. Try to despawn enemies that are right near the ladder. 

Get in the water and walk all the way over to the right. 

#### Plauge Rat of Doom:

- Jeff MBR
- Others Defend

Go up, learn the new melody, and pick up the Carrot key. 

Go back down into the sewer and use the Exit mouse. 

When you exit, without walking anywhere, use Teleport α to go to Dalaam. Hold down+right to run over the photo shoot trigger, then switch to up+right once you're in the street to finish the teleport. 

## Pink Cloud

Note: RUN from all encounters

Use Carrot Key on statues in south Dalaam

Take the ropes up. Have Poo use a Skip sandwich DX when you hit the top.

Always fall down the hole farthest to the left. 

#### Thunder & Storm:

- Jeff: MBR
- Poo: StarstormA

Learn the new melody. 

Go back in and fall down the hole on the right side. 

Take the ropes back up and out. 

## Lost Underworld Fun

Teleport to Onett and get another Exit Mouse.

Teleport to the Lost Underworld. 

#### Enemies:

- Dinosaurs: Run
- Soul Consuming Flame: Freeze/bash
- Elementals/Psychos: Hypnotize & run

Go northeast a bit and pick up the Sea pendant. It should go to either Ness or Paula. Equip it on Poo so that he can revive if the rest of the party wipes. Alternativly you can equip it on Ness to save some menuing later. 

Go west, then South to Fire Spring

#### Fire Spring: (TODO Maze Notes)

Walk to the right and stop at bottom of rope for a couple seconds to despawn enemy.

Keep going to the right and enter the second door. Go in and out of this door until either the passage is clear or the enemies are both running from you. In the latter case, try to ambush them. 

Go up the rope and into the door above. See if you can either despawn the enemy or get it far enough away that you can escape up the rope (though it sometimes spawns on top of you). 

Again try to either despawn or ambush the enemies in the narrow passage. 

Go up the two ropes and in the door up there. If there are a lot of enemies, have Poo use a Skip sandwich DX after your fight on the middle platform so you can hopefully run into the door before the enemies on the top get you. 

Go to the door on the far left of the large room. Take the fight. Have Ness use hypnosis on the Super Phychic Phycho, Paula freeze the Flame, Jeff Defend, and Poo bash the Flame as well. Run on Turn 2. 

Climb up to the top. You can have Poo use another Skip sandwich DX to try to get past enemies, either in the middle or at the top. 

Before the fight with Diamond Dog, have Paula give the Rabbit's foot to Jeff and equip the Rabbit's foot on him (again, if Paula is dead, make sure you don't drop it).  Make sure to revive and lifeup all dead party members. 

Fight Diamond dog. This is an easy fight (it may not actually be an easy fight). There are a couple strategies: 
If you have 7+ rockets left, or if you have 6 rockets and Paula and/or Poo are dead or low on PP... 

On the first turn, have Ness use Lifeup β on Jeff and have Jeff shoot a Multi bottle rocket while Poo and Paula defend. 
On the next two turns, have Jeff shoot more Multi bottle rockets while everyone else defends. 
Jeff should get the second and third rockets into Diamond Dog before he dies from the shield deflection. 

If you have 6 rockets left and Paula and Poo have good HP/PP, or if you are down to 5 rockets... 
On the first turn, have Ness use Lifeup β on Jeff, Paula use Freeze γ, Jeff shoot a Multi bottle rocket, and Poo use Starstorm α. 
On the second turn, have Ness defend, Paula use Freeze γ, Jeff shoot another rocket, and Poo use Starstorm α. 
Diamond dog should hopefully be dead by this point, but if not, have Paula and Poo keep using Psi to end the fight. Ness can help out with Rockin β if Paula and Poo run out of PP. 

Learn the melody of Fire Spring, then use your Exit mouse. 

## Mondo Mole

Teleport to Onett, get another Exit mouse. 

Teleport to Twoson. 

Walk to Peaceful Rest Valley and continue on into Happy-Happy Village. 

Walk to Mondo Mole and auto fight him to death. None of the enemies should come after you at your current level. 

Learn the melody, then use the Exit mouse to get out. 

## Trillionage Sprout

Teleport to Saturn Valley, teleport as soon as you leave the cave and hold left

Go through the cave up to the middle platform and take the ladder on the right to the top. 

Hug the right side of the hot spring and then hug the sign next to the entrance to Milky Well before going in. This avoids the photo shoot right in front of the entrance. 

Have Poo use a Skip sandwich DX somewhere in the first tunnel to help you run past enemies. Some of them will chase you, some won't. You can either run from the ones who attack you or use Starstorm. 

If you have at least 4 Multi bottle rockets left, fire one at Trillionage Sprout. You should probably still fire one even if you just have 3, unless you're worried about making Giygas riskier. If you're down to 2, use Rockin/Fire/Starstorm until you win. 

Before going past the shining spot, have Jeff give the Rabbit's foot to Ness and Poo give Ness the Sea pendant(if he has it) and equip it on Ness. 

In a serious run, you probably shouldn't pause to check your inventory, but if you must, Ness should have these, among other things: 

Rabbit's foot (equipped) 
Night pendant or Sea pendant 
Franklin badge 
2 Bags of Dragonite 
2 Super bombs 
2 Skip sandwich DXes 

Learn the final melody and go on into Magicant. 

Ness's Nightmare 

With the Rabbit's foot equipped, you can run from all of the enemies in Magicant in a few turns except the Loaded Dice. Use Paralysis on those before attempting to run. You can also hypnotize Uncontrollable Spheres and French Kisses of Death. 

Walk up to the red part of Magicant. Use a Skip sandwich DX to help you dodge enemies and open up an inventory slot. 

Take the first fork over to the right and get the Bag of Dragonite from the gift box. 

Go back to the main path and continue on. Your sandwich should run out just before you reach the next gift box. Use another Skip sandwich DX and then get the Magicant bat from the box. 

Run all the way to the end of the path. 

When you reach the Sea of Eden, equip the Magicant bat and Sea pendant.  

Wait for the first Kraken to get far enough down and to the right that you can slip by it. 

If you end up in a fight with it, bash it to death. Heal if you need to heal, though the fight's actually pretty easy with the Sea pendant and Franklin badge. 

Try to get the second Kraken stuck behind one of the spires so you can get around it. 

Try to avoid the third Kraken completely. 

Fight Ness's Nightmare. Use your three Bags of Dragonite, then switch to Super bombs. If that's not enough, you can try bashing and hoping for a smash. If you have to. stall out the fight using lifeup and defending until he runs out of pp then bash it to death. Hopefully it doesn't come to that though. 

**Phase Distorter** 

Equip the Rabbit's foot on Ness again when you get back. 

Talk to Dr. Andonuts and get in the Phase Distorter. Tell Dr. Andonuts that you have seen a meteorite recently. 

Teleport to Onett. 

Walk up to the meteorite. Use Teleport α to dodge enemies. If you get in a fight, just run. Only Ness needs to be alive for this part (though having multiple party members helps if someone gets diamondized). 

Check the meteorite to get the Meteorite piece. Teleport back to Saturn Valley. 

Use the Meteorite piece on Dr. Andonuts. 

Stay in the hotel. 

Talk to Dr. Andonuts twice, saying both times that you're ready. 

Get in the Phase Distorter. 

If you're out of Cups of Lifenoodles, check the wrecked Phase Distorter for a Horn of Life. 

Walk about halfway down the upper peninsula, then turn around and go back to spawn Dr. Andonuts and Apple Kid. 
Talk to Apple Kid, then to Dr. Andonuts, and then to Andonuts again after he walks to the end of the peninsula. Keep saying, "Yes," when he asks. 

**Giygas** 

Run through the past, to Giygas's lair. Have Poo use Skip sandwiches to minimize the fights you get in. Run from everything. 
When you get into Giygas's lair, rearrange your inventory as follows: 

Give the Sea pendant to Paula, if Ness has it. 
Give the Franklin badge to Paula. 
Give the Rabbit's foot to Jeff 
Give the horn of life or a cup of life noodles to Poo 

Equip the Night pendant on Ness, the Sea pendant on Paula, and the Rabbit's foot on Jeff. 

Giygas phase 1: 
Have Ness paralyze pokey, Paula use Psi Shield Σ, and Jeff shoot a Multi bottle rocket at Pokey. Have Poo use the Lifenoodles or horn of life on Paula. (this is just in case Giygas opens with Rockin B and kills Paula 

On the next turn, Ness can heal someone, bash Pokey, throw another Super bomb, or continue with Paralysis if it didn't work the first time. Paula can use her strongest Freeze . Jeff should fire another rocket. If Poo has more than 93 PP, he can use Freeze β on Pokey; otherwise, he should defend. 

If the fight continues, have Ness keep bashing, Paula keep freezing, and Jeff keep shooting (unless he's out of rockets). Three rockets plus the other damage should be enough... 

Giygas phase 2: 
Have Ness use his strongest Rockin, Paula use her strongest Freeze, Jeff defend, and Poo use Starstorm Ω. Repeat. 

Giygas phase 3: 

Have Ness use Lifeup on Paula if she's low on HP.  
Have Paula pray until you win while the others defend. 
Everyone else defend, Ideally You want everyone but Paula to be dead in this phase. 
SRL time ends the moment Paulas Prayers Text starts ( the one after the prayer gets absorbed by Darkness) 

Epilogue 

Tell Paula you will not escort her home. 

Teleport to Onett. 

As you approach Ness's house, line up below the gap in the fence so you're on the right-ish side. 

Use Teleport α to run into the door to Ness's house and hold up when you land. This skips the photo shoot at the gap in the fence and should hopefully skip Paula's dialogue at the door. 
Talk to Ness's mom a couple times. 
Go downstairs and talk to Picky. 

SPLIT (end JRTA Time) 


TO DO: 

Add video's to show how to do some of the execution heavy parts of the run 

Go through and fix all my terrible typo's.
