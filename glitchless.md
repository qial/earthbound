These Notes are a More up to date version of the SDA notes written by UUSDFG. I literally copy pasted it and changed the stuff that was out of date. This route is going with no RNG manipulation in mind. 

**General** 

Assume you should avoid all battles unless otherwise noted. 

If an enemy drops an item and you don't know what to do with it, plan on dropping it at some point so it doesn't force you to rearrange your items later. If you keep it, keep in mind that items won't go where they're expected. 

Stutter-stepping: by quickly and lightly tapping the dpad in any given direction, certain enemies can be avoided as their movement is based on your movement frames. 

Any time there is text mash with A and L-trigger as fast as you can. Note that during long text sequences the A+L combination will automatically choose "Yes", while mashing B+Select will automatically choose "No" if those options present themselves. 

Despawning: if you walk off and back on screen when you see an enemy you can despawn them. horizontal enemies take about 1/3 of a screen and vertical enemies take about 1/2

## Moonside

Leave the Moonside cafe. Try to get past the Robo-Pump that spawns here. If it fights you either try to run away or use a Big Bottle Rocket 

Outside, go southeast and talk to the nearest Warp Man to head down by the sailor guy. 

Talk to the sailor guy, then go up to the northeast and talk to the Warp Man near the hospital steps. 

Pick up the Night pendant from the nearby gift box and equip it on Ness. 


Go through the Warp Man sequence, Before you talk to the guy in black grab the secret herb in the present above him and make sure ness has it. Then talk to the guy in black answering, "No," to the last one's question. 

Talk to the invisible man (say, "No") and then talk to Mr. T. 

Walk to the bottom edge of the hotel room and the go all the way right before going out the door. This prevents the invisible man's dialogue from triggering. 

Go west and talk to the Warp Man you talked to earlier (not the one farthest to the east) to go back down by the sailor guy. 

Talk to the sailor guy, then head over to the statue. Make sure you're as far up as you can be when you check the statue so you skip Monotoli's dialogue. 

To fight Mani-Mani: 
Have Ness throw a Super bomb while Jeff shoots a Big bottle rocket. 
If Mani-Mani is still alive after that, have Ness use Rockin while Jeff shoots a Big bottle rocket. That really should do it. 

If Ness is paralyzed, have Jeff launch Big bottle rockets. If Jeff is paralyzed, have Ness use his secret herb on jeff and then use Rockin β. 

**Monkey Cave** 

If Ness was paralyzed, move the Pencil eraser into Jeff's inventory. 

Leave the cafe. Talk to the monkey who crashes into the nearby wall. 

Walk down to the bus stop and take a bus into Dusty Dunes. 

Go into the hole with the monkeys (dodge the mole on the way in). 

Give a Skip sandwich to the monkey on the right, then a Picnic lunch to the monkey on the left. 

Go in the left door and get the Pizza out of the chest. Go out the door you just came in. 

Go in the right door and proceed to the next set of monkeys. Ignore the chests here. 

Give a Pizza to the right monkey and a Protein drink to the left monkey. 

Go in the right door. Pick up the Hamburger from the chest and continue into the next room. 

Give Jeff's Ruler to the monkey on the left and go in. Get the King banana from the monkey inside. 

Go back out to the last group of two monkeys, and this time, go in the left door. Ignore the chests you pass. 

Give the King banana to the right monkey and the Hamburger to the left monkey. 

Go in the left door and get the Bag of Dragonite from the chest. 

Go back in the right door. Use the Pencil eraser. 

Talk to Talah Rama and the monkey. 

Get the Cup of Lifenoodles and Brain food lunch from the chests. Both should go into Ness's inventory. 

Walk out. Talk to the monkey on the left, then follow it down to the street and talk to it again (dodge the mole). 

Teleport into Fourside. 

**Clumsy Robot** 

Talk to Electra in front of the Monotoli Building. 

Go into the Monotoli Building and take the two elevators up. 

Go from the top elevator into the lobby. Use the Skip Sandwich DX just before entering the next room. 

Skip the Sentry Robots. 

Hug the top wall and go into the right door as quickly as possible to dodge the first Sentry Robot. 

Run to the door on the left. 

Continue left and go into the next door. If the second Sentry Robot is blocking it, try to go around it and run into the door on the far left. 

Go under the desks to pin the third Sentry Robot against them, then wrap around the desks to the upper-left corner of the room. 
 
Squeeze between the desk in the upper left and the wall and go through the door at the top. 

Go through the left door in the next room. 

Go up-left until you've reached the top wall, then go left a little and through the door at the top. This should get you around the last Sentry Robot. 

Go through the left door again. 

Fight Clumsy Robot. You should have 4 total super bombs left at this point. Those usually kill it. 
If you do get bad luck, about all you can do is Paralyze it and then Auto Fight. The hyper beam we bought earlier is in case this happens. 

Go into Monotoli's room. You have a decision to make here. 

If Ness and Jeff have plenty of HP and Ness isn't low on PP, hold down+left and talk to Monotoli before he can run from you. This is about three seconds faster than letting him run. Make sure the pillar in the top left of the room is visable when you talk to him or you will soft-lock the game. 

If Ness or Jeff need to be healed, let Monotoli run from you. This is probably faster than skipping his dialogue and then healing later. 

Make sure you tell Monotoli that you don't want him to repeat his story (mash B+Select through his dialogue). 

If you didn't stay at the shack after the mine and Paula is low on HP, have Ness heal her now. 

Go outside and watch Pokey fly away. Walk back outside and get on the bus (note that you don't need to talk to anyone this time). 

Walk up to the entrance to the prison. The fastest route takes you past the hospital and circus tent, but watch out for the photo shoot near the tent (it helps to stay close to the fence until you're east of the tent). 

If you skipped the Teddy bear earlier, go back to the trash can northeast of the graveyard and pick up the bear on the way into the prison. 

Get on the Sky Runner. 

## Shrooom!

- Others: Paralysis

Go to pyramid, walk tiles to open.

Position behind the sphynx with ness's head showing, teleport up, hold up to get in

#### TODO: Pyramid strategy

Go in and out of the door until the first room is clear. Go up and down the stairs in the second room until the platform at the top is clear. 

Just before going through the door at the top of the stairs, have Paula use a Skip sandwich DX. 

Hold down when entering the next room. Go down to the last "crack" before the bottom of the room, then go right until you're below the other door, then go up. You should skip the hieroglyph. 

Go up the stairs in the next room. Go down+right slightly when you get to the middle platform, then hit up+right again near the next stairs. This should take you past the hieroglyphs in the middle. At the top platform, hold right until you are next to the door, then hit up to skip the snake. 

Take whatever fight you get in the middle room (the one with the casket covering the entrance to the Hawk eye room). Paralyze the enemies and run. 

Just before you go out the door on the right side of the middle room, have Paula use another Skip sandwich DX. 

Hold right and then tap down when you hit the stairs. You should bypass the hieroglyphs. 

In the room with the two coffins, just take whatever fight you get and use Paralysis or Hypnosis as necessary. If there are no enemies in the room, go down-right-up to dodge the hieroglyph on the wall. 

If Ness used his Cup of Lifenoodles earlier, pick up the one in the coffin on the right. 

Once again hold right and then tap down at the stairs to skip the asp. 

Go down and fight Guardian General. Have Paula and Poo use their strongest Freeze while Jeff fires a Big bottle rocket. If that doesn't do it, use Freeze some more (or use any remaining rockets). 

Go into the room on the right and hit the tile. Use Paralysis or whatever if you have to. 

If Ness is below 30 PP or so, use Poo's Brain food lunch on him. 

Go back up. Have Paula use another Skip sandwich as you near the top of the second stairs in the room that used to have Guardian General. Try to dodge hieroglyphs on the way back to the middle room (it's tricky). 

When you get into the room with the hole above the Hawk eye, if there are enemies in the room, fight the Guardian Hieroglyph on the wall just by the door you came in, then have Paula use a Skip sandwich DX and run into the hole to get by the enemies. If there are no enemies, have her use a Skip sandwich DX and run around that Guardian Hieroglyph to get into the room. 

Pick up the Hawk eye in the room below. 

Dodge the hieroglyph in this room and at the top of the stairs in the next room. 

In the room at the top of the stairs, go down to the bottom of the room (make sure you reach the bottom edge), then go right and around the hole and get the Diamond band out of the coffin. 

Make sure your previous sandwich has worn off, then have Paula use another one. 

Fall down the hole and try to ambush whatever enemy you get. 

Go into the last room and just hold right. At most one hieroglyph should come off the wall at you. Tap up when you reach the door. 

#### END Pyramid TODO

## Dungeon Man

Talk to the native for Key to the Tower

Teleport holding up+left from above merchant.

Walk through Dungeon Man. 

Talk to Dungeon Man when you get to the top.

On first floor, go right and get Talisman Ribbon if you didn't get 20k+ from ATM

#### Master Barf:

- Jeff MBR, should kill

Enter Tenda then immediately leave 

Take the phone call and then teleport into Winters. 

## Winters and Starmen

NOTE: Starmen seem to always face "up," so if you have a clear shot at a Starman after it's teleported, you can run into its left or right to ambush it. 

Go down through Winters, across Lake Tess. 

Despawn the enemies by the pencil eraser the same way you despawned the goat as Jeff. 

Use Pencil Eraser on statue

Walk through cave, enemies will run.

Go into the lab. Use the revitalizer to refill your PP, then talk to the mouse to get the Eraser eraser. It should go into Paula's stuff. 

Go to Stonehenge. 

## Stonehenge Base (TODO STRATS)

When you first enter, wait at entrance for a few seconds to despawn starman.

Move Eraser eraser to Paula, use it to remove statue.

Try to run from most encounters in here. Have Ness hypnotize Mook Seniors before running. 

Take the right path in the second room. Turn right where the paths rejoin in the third room. You can probably despawn enemies without too much trouble at this point. 

In the fifth room (the one with the really high spawn rate), go in and out the door until you have a clear-ish path, then use a Skip sandwich DX from Poo's inventory to give yourself a better chance of ambushing enemies or simply bypassing them. Despawning enemies in this room is probably not worth the effort. 

Have Poo use another Skip sandwich DX when you get to the bottom of the first ladder in the next room. 

Pick up an Exit mouse. 

#### Starman Deluxe:

- Jeff MBR (Should kill it)
- Paula/Poo FreezeB

Talk to the strong guy to move the rock blocking the rope. 

**Talk to the rock at the bottom of the rope. ITS IMPORTANT!!**

#### Lumine Hall TODO (Maze Strats/reminders)

- Fobbies: Starstorm if more than a couple
- Uncontrollable Spheres: Hypnotize and run
- Others: Freeze 'em

Go north to the rope at the dead end, near the gift box. Take that rope down. 

Go around to the rope at the far end. Ignore the first rope you pass. 

Have Poo use a Skip sandwich DX when you take the last rope out to make it easier to run past Fobbies. 

If the path to the present below  is open get it now to pick up the Rabits foot and equip it on Jeff Otherwise Fight Electro Specter 

Have Jeff launch two Multi bottle rockets. shoot another incase it doesnt work 

Pick up the Rabit Foot now if you havent already and equip it on paula. and requip the crystal charm on Jeff.  

Once you've gotten the Rabbit's foot, move the following out of Ness's inventory and into Paula's or Poo's, depending on whether Paula has room. 

Go back up, learn the new melody, and fall down the hole. 

## Plague Rat Sanctuary

Teleport into Fourside. 

Go into the museum and try to enter without paying. Agree to pay. Talk to Mr. Spoon in the back.

Go back to the museum and use the Signed banana on Mr. Spoon.

Get in the water and walk all the way over to the right. 

#### Plauge Rat of Doom:

Go up, learn the new melody, and pick up the Carrot key. 

Go back down into the sewer and use the Exit mouse. 

When you exit, without walking anywhere, use Teleport α to go to Dalaam. Hold down+right to run over the photo shoot trigger, then switch to up+right once you're in the street to finish the teleport. 

## Pink Cloud

Note: RUN from all encounters

Use Carrot Key on statues in south Dalaam

Take the ropes up. Have Poo use a Skip sandwich DX when you hit the top.

Always fall down the hole farthest to the left. 

#### Thunder & Storm:

- Jeff: MBR
- Poo: StarstormA

Learn the new melody. 

Go back in and fall down the hole on the right side. 

Take the ropes back up and out. 

## Lost Underworld Fun

Teleport to Onett and get another Exit Mouse.

Teleport to the Lost Underworld. 

#### Enemies:

- Dinosaurs: Run
- Soul Consuming Flame: Freeze/bash
- Elementals/Psychos: Hypnotize & run

Go northeast a bit and pick up the Sea pendant. It should go to either Ness or Paula. Equip it on Poo so that he can revive if the rest of the party wipes. Alternativly you can equip it on Ness to save some menuing later. 

Go west, then South to Fire Spring

#### Fire Spring: (TODO Maze Notes)

Walk to the right and stop at bottom of rope for a couple seconds to despawn enemy.

Keep going to the right and enter the second door. Go in and out of this door until either the passage is clear or the enemies are both running from you. In the latter case, try to ambush them. 

Go up the rope and into the door above. See if you can either despawn the enemy or get it far enough away that you can escape up the rope (though it sometimes spawns on top of you). 

Again try to either despawn or ambush the enemies in the narrow passage. 

Go up the two ropes and in the door up there. If there are a lot of enemies, have Poo use a Skip sandwich DX after your fight on the middle platform so you can hopefully run into the door before the enemies on the top get you. 

Go to the door on the far left of the large room. Take the fight. Have Ness use hypnosis on the Super Phychic Phycho, Paula freeze the Flame, Jeff Defend, and Poo bash the Flame as well. Run on Turn 2. 

Climb up to the top. You can have Poo use another Skip sandwich DX to try to get past enemies, either in the middle or at the top. 

Before the fight with Diamond Dog, have Paula give the Rabbit's foot to Jeff and equip the Rabbit's foot on him (again, if Paula is dead, make sure you don't drop it).  Make sure to revive and lifeup all dead party members. 

Fight Diamond dog. This is an easy fight (it may not actually be an easy fight). There are a couple strategies: 
If you have 7+ rockets left, or if you have 6 rockets and Paula and/or Poo are dead or low on PP... 

On the first turn, have Ness use Lifeup β on Jeff and have Jeff shoot a Multi bottle rocket while Poo and Paula defend. 
On the next two turns, have Jeff shoot more Multi bottle rockets while everyone else defends. 
Jeff should get the second and third rockets into Diamond Dog before he dies from the shield deflection. 

If you have 6 rockets left and Paula and Poo have good HP/PP, or if you are down to 5 rockets... 
On the first turn, have Ness use Lifeup β on Jeff, Paula use Freeze γ, Jeff shoot a Multi bottle rocket, and Poo use Starstorm α. 
On the second turn, have Ness defend, Paula use Freeze γ, Jeff shoot another rocket, and Poo use Starstorm α. 
Diamond dog should hopefully be dead by this point, but if not, have Paula and Poo keep using Psi to end the fight. Ness can help out with Rockin β if Paula and Poo run out of PP. 

Learn the melody of Fire Spring, then use your Exit mouse. 

## Mondo Mole

Teleport to Onett, get another Exit mouse. 

Teleport to Twoson. 

Walk to Peaceful Rest Valley and continue on into Happy-Happy Village. 

Walk to Mondo Mole and auto fight him to death. None of the enemies should come after you at your current level.

## Trillionage Sprout

Teleport to Saturn Valley, teleport as soon as you leave the cave and hold left

Go up to the hot springs.

Hug the right side of the hot spring and then hug the sign next to the entrance to Milky Well before going in. This avoids the photo shoot right in front of the entrance. 

Use Poo SkipDX in the first tunnel to run from enemies. If any attack, use StarstormA

#### Trillionage Sprout:

- 4+ MBR, use MBR. (3+ fine, but makes Giygas riskier)
- 2 MBR, use Rockin/Fire/Starstorm until you win

Before going to sanctuary:

- Give Rabbit's Foot & Sea Pendant to Ness and equip

Ness Check:

- Rabbit's foot (equipped)

- Run from all else, with Rabbit's Foot it shouldn't be too many turns
- Uncontrollable Spheres: hypnotize if needed
- French Kiss of Death: hypnotize if needed

Walk up to the red part of Magicant. Use a Skip sandwich DX to help you dodge enemies and open up an inventory slot. 

Take the first fork over to the right and get the Bag of Dragonite from the gift box. 

Go back to the main path and continue on. Your sandwich should run out just before you reach the next gift box. Use another Skip sandwich DX and then get the Magicant bat from the box. 

Run all the way to the end of the path. 

Sea of Eden, equip the Magicant bat and Sea pendant.  

Wait for the first Kraken to get far enough down and to the right that you can slip by it. 

If you end up in a fight with it, bash it to death. Heal if you need to heal, though the fight's actually pretty easy with the Sea pendant and Franklin badge. 

Try to get the second Kraken stuck behind one of the spires so you can get around it. 

Try to avoid the third Kraken completely. 

#### Ness's Nightmare

- Use 3 Bags of Dragonite
- Then Super Bombs
- Bash after. 
- Worst case stall out using lifeups until NN PP runs out then bash to death.

Epilogue 

Tell Paula you will not escort her home. 

Teleport to Onett. 

As you approach Ness's house, line up below the gap in the fence so you're on the right-ish side. 

Use Teleport α to run into the door to Ness's house and hold up when you land. This skips the photo shoot at the gap in the fence and should hopefully skip Paula's dialogue at the door. 
Talk to Ness's mom a couple times. 
Go downstairs and talk to Picky.
