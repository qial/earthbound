Defensive items for ness for belch/after?

Is fourside shopping right? I had to drop skip sandwich and the DX to make room.
My silver bracelet was a mistake but waht was the other inventory slot?

MonkeyCave:
 Give a Pizza to the right monkey and a Protein drink to the left monkey.  This is flipped
After getting a king banana, exit that room, and then return to the previous monkey room, that's more clear
exit dragonite room, go in right door


at SHROOM:
How does ness have room for 5 super bombs? He only has room for 4.
Should Jeff have fly honey? that would solve the other issues
Ness: receiver, pencil, sound, franklin, fly honey, dragonite, brain food, lifenoodles, night pendant, 4 super bombs

after shattered man
It says move pencil eraser to paula if you put it in jeff, is it okay to leave on ness?

need 98 * 17 + 80 monies for skip sandwiches and boat fare, figure that out
And 1200 for crystal charms for jeff and paula

text update: In scaraba head southeast to bazaar, talk to southwest most man in purple for crystal charms

Make sure you have a big bottle rocket for the guardian at this point

Pyramid is southeast of the town exit

text update: pyramid walking is north, southwest, east, west, southeast, north

You have to use Check to get into dungeon man. Fucking bullshit fuckersjldfksdvjklodvjklhnw

tendakraut is spelled wrong in tenda village section
elder is the guy you talk to with the book

lumine hall is confusing, you have to fall down to learn the melody, then fall to underworld, then teleport out

Explain why you shouldn't move after leaving the dinosaur museum. (photo guy)

LOL after thunder and storm it says to teleport to onett, not underworld
NVM its right, just the dinosaur stuff should be later. wat.
